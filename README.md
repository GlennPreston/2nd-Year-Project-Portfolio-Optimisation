# 2nd-Year-Project-Portfolio-Optimisation
A solo project where I was given a spreadsheet which contained the percentages the stock of 500 seperate companies changed each day over a period of three and a half years. I was tasked to parse this data and find the combination of stocks that returned the lowest volatility while also staying below the investment amount available.
